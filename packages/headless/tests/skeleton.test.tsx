/**
 * Skeleton smoke test for the `@vryzel/file-next-headless` package.
 *
 * Purpose: prove that the test infrastructure (jsdom, react plugin,
 * jest-dom matchers, workspace project registration) is wired end-
 * to-end BEFORE any of the 5 hooks land. If this fails, the
 * skeleton is broken — the per-hook tests will not be runnable.
 *
 * The test renders a trivial hook (a one-liner `useState`) and
 * asserts the React tree mounts + a setter update propagates. This
 * is intentionally MINIMAL (no real hook under test) — its job is
 * to catch env / config regressions, not to test real behavior.
