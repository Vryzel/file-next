/**
 * Build smoke test for the `./server` subpath (T-051).
 *
 * The library's own `server/index.ts` is the testable surface —
 * it does NOT include `import "server-only"` (that would break
 * vitest under jsdom, per the PR 1 discovery). The `./server`
 * package.json subpath maps to `dist/server/index.{js,cjs,d.ts}`,
 * which IS the production entry and DOES re-export the
 * `server-only` package.
 *
 * This test asserts the build output shape. It runs as part of
 * `pnpm test:run`, but skips cleanly when the dist hasn't been
 * built (so CI can run `pnpm build` first, then `pnpm test:run`,
 * OR the local dev loop can run tests without rebuilding).
